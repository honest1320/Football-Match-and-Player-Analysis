Lukaku's xA (Expected Assists) value of 6.34 also indicates his ability to create goal-scoring opportunities for his teammates. On the other hand, Ronaldo's xA of 3.42 shows his contribution in this aspect but falls short compared to Lukaku. \\n\\nIn terms of expected threat (xT), both players had similar xT values, with Lukaku slightly edging out Ronaldo. Lukaku's xT from passes and carries were 0.92 and 2.10 respectively, while Ronaldo's were 0.92 and 2.88. This suggests that both players were equally effective in increasing their team's scoring probability through their actions on the field.\\n\\nDribbling is another key aspect of creation, and Ronaldo had a higher success rate in dribbling with a 61.05% success rate compared to Lukaku's 56.99%. Ronaldo won 58 out of 95 attempted dribbles, showcasing his skill and ability to beat defenders on the field.\\n\\n**Finishing:**\\nWhen it comes to finishing, Cristiano Ronaldo had a remarkable season in 2020, scoring 29 goals with an xG (Expected Goals) value of 28.94. This indicates that Ronaldo not only met but also exceeded expectations in terms of goal-scoring. On the other hand, Romelu Lukaku scored 24 goals with an xG value of 24.80, suggesting that he performed close to expectations in this aspect.\\n\\nIn terms of aerial dominance, Ronaldo's offensive AERO rating of 72.28 outshines Lukaku's rating of 62.60. This indicates Ronaldo's superiority in winning offensive aerial duels against opponents, showcasing his physical presence and effectiveness in the air.\\n\\n**Overall Conclusion:**\\nIn conclusion, both Cristiano Ronaldo and Romelu Lukaku had impressive performances in the 2020 season. While Lukaku excelled in creating goal-scoring opportunities for his team with more assists and a higher xA value, Ronaldo stood out in finishing with a higher goal tally and overperforming his xG. Ronaldo's aerial dominance also gives him an edge in terms of physicality and effectiveness in offensive aerial duels.
